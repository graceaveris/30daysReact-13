**Day Thirteen - 30 days of React challenge - "New Zealand Weather" app**

Today i've connected again to https://openweathermap.org/ API to display current weather in New Zealand, with major city data pre-loaded and additional city select. 

**Concepts Explored:**
- API calls with React
- Connecting to an API and using componentDidMount
- Using a loading screen while you're waiting for your API data

Follow me as I self-learn React.js. Each day for thirty days i'll be creating a simple app and posting about it, (attempting to) explain my code, and discuss what I have learned. By the end of day 30 I hope to have a basic working knowledge of React.js and its applications!
