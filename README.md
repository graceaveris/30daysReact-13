Day Thirteen // 30 days of React challenge // "New Zealad Weather" app

Today i've connected to https://openweathermap.org/ API to display current weather in New Zealand, with major city data pre-loaded.

Follow me programming noob as I stumble my way through self-learning React.js. Each day for thirty days i'll be creating a simple app and posting about it, (attempting to) explain my code, and discuss what I have learned.

By the end of day 30 I hope to have a basic working knowledge of React.js and its applications!
